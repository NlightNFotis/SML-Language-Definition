SML-Language-Definition
=======================

A .tmLanguage language definition for SML. Provides syntax highlighting in Sublime Text 2.

To use, copy the .tmLanguage and .tmPreferences files into your Packages/User directory. Use the Preferences>Browse Packages 
menu to get to the Packages directory.

The .JSON-* files can be used to generate the .tm* files. You may need the "AAAPackageDev"
package for the JSON build to work.

Also included is an example theme that works with the SML language definition, and a snippet for SML function blocks.
